# Plan for Next Year

## Controllers & Hardware

1. Decide if we should use a separate controller for drive train logic.
2. Decide what display should be used for the system
3. Purchase an RPi
4. Purchase a CAN hat for RPi
5. Research new controller options (reach out to DANFOS, JCA, SWL, DeweSoft, etc...)
6. Purchase new controller
7. Purchase new display (?)
8. Research PCB design
9. Update PCB board design (naming, cut unnecessary stuff, etc...)
10. Get new boards ordered for the control board and relay board

## Software

1. Split up project into _Display_ and _Controller_
2. Setup RPi as an Access Point
3. Get Websockets working

## New member package

Basics
- Git intro
- GitHub intro
- Development flow and design tutorials (tickets, pull requests, etc...)

Frontend
- HTML & CSS intro
- Vuejs intro
- FastAPI intro

PCB part component tutorials
- Figure out wiring diagram software
- GPIO expander
- ADC
- Potentiometer

Eventually
- CAN tutorial
- Style Guides

## Other

- Look into taking over development of the team's website
- Look into doing some 3D printing for the control boards (work with mechanicals maybe)
- Figure out a better display mounting / user control center (again work with mechanicals for that, research how current tractors do it).

## Parts

- MCP23S17-E/SP (GPIO expander)
- (ADC)
- bread boards
- wiring
- resistors
- LEDs
- Switches (button or toggle)
