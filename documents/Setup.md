## Picking a Code Editor

There are lots of good code editors out there. Pycharm, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Pycharm are just some of
the many great tools out there that can be used completely free. However, for the purposes of these tutorials, I will
be demonstrating everything using Pycharm. I highly recommend PyCharm, as well as all the other JetBrain products for
a few key reasons:

1. Professional versions of all their products (PyCharm, WebStorm, DataGrip, and CLion just to name a couple) can be
downloaded completely free as a student. Seeing as this is a University Design Team, that means every member will have
access to these products completely free.
2. It is cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux) and their products provide tailor-made support for a wide range of
programming languages.
3. It has a wide variety of built-in tools, so you rarely have to go looking for extra plug-ins (and if it doesn't have
the tool installed it's often smart enough to recommend one to you).
4. Excellent git management, virtual environment control, and very smart refactoring tools
5. Like most other code editors, most everything is customizable and a wide array of shortcuts exist to help improve
your workflow.

If you plan to go the route of JetBrain products (ie. PyCharm) I recommend first downloading their software management
tool, _JetBrains Toolbox_, from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/toolbox/).
